# C++ Socket Client-Server Project

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of a client-server model using C++ sockets. The server accepts connections from clients and can handle multiple clients simultaneously. The client sends a message to the server and the server echoes the message back to the client.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* C++ Compiler (GCC recommended)
* Linux/Unix environment for socket programming

### Installing
* Clone the repository
* Navigate to the project directory
* Create a new build directory and navigate to the directory
* Use command CMake for building binary files for the module
* Execute 'ServerApp' and 'ClientApp' for running executable files
* Execute 'TestServer' and 'TestClient' for running test cases

### Executing program
* Run the server program first
* Run the client program in a different terminal
